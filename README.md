# Discord Interaction Engine

This is a framework built using discord.js for creating easy commands using slash commands.

## Documentation

This package currently has very lacking documentation currently. Feel free to contribute.

## Versioning

This project does **NOT** use semver for the major number but rather follows the major version number of discord.js, HOWEVER there will never be **breaking** changes for this library within one discord.js version. If a breaking change must be implemented, it will be implemented when discord.js changes version. This means that a major version bump might or might not be a breaking change, but any other bump will still never be a breaking change.
